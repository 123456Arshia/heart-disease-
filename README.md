# Heart Disease Prediction



This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using advanced algorithms. By utilizing the power of machine learning, we aim to create an accurate model that can assess an individual's risk of heart disease based on a range of medical attributes.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a significant global health concern, and early prediction can make a substantial difference in patient outcomes. This project leverages the UCI Heart Disease dataset to construct a robust Random Forest Classifier. This classifier is trained to anticipate the presence of heart disease based on an individual's medical data, leading to informed decisions and timely interventions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/123456Arshia/heart-disease-
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```sh
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the Dataset:
   - Download the UCI Heart Disease dataset (heart.csv) from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).
   - Place the dataset in the `data` directory of the project.

## Usage

1. Run the `heart_disease_prediction.py` Script:
   ```sh
   python heart_disease_prediction.py
   ```

2. Explore and Customize:
   - Experiment with the script to tweak parameters and techniques.
   - Modify the Random Forest model's hyperparameters for fine-tuning.
   - Adapt the preprocessing steps as required for specific use cases.

## Results

Upon running the script, you'll be presented with the model's accuracy on the test set and a detailed classification report. Furthermore, the script allows you to predict whether an individual is likely to have heart disease based on their medical information.
